Hacked 2023
Creating an amazing music recommendation system using a sample dataset from Spotify 

1. Spotify keeps track of metadata and audio features for songs that we can use to build music recommendation systems.
2. We use a spotipy which is a python spotify web client API for developers to fetch data from spotify.
3. In this Hackathon we have demonstrated how you can use this data to build a simple content-based music recommender system with the cosine distance metric.
